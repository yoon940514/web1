<h2>3.Cardano</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)" target="_blank">Cardano</a> is a public blockchain platform. <br> It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency, Ada.</p>
<p>Cardano was founded in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. The development of the project is overseen and supervised by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland.[5][6] It is also the largest cryptocurrency to use a proof-of-stake blockchain, which is seen as a greener alternative to proof-of-work protocols</p>
